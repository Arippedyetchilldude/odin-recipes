        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe 
            with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls 
            for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
            Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.<br> Homemade lasagna isn't as hard
            to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor 
            â€” try this homemade lasagna recipe today!

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef and pork over medium heat until evenly brown. 
                Drain, and stir in the onion. Season with salt and pepper, and cook until the onion is tender. 
                Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon parsley, oregano, and sugar. Simmer for about 30 minutes, 
                stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles for 8 to 10 minutes.

                Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 3 noodles over the sauce, 
                and top with half of the cottage cheese mixture. Spread with 1 cup of meat sauce, and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. 
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
